   <div className='text-4xl font-bold mb-5'>Case Study - AI Career Coach Analyzer </div> 
   <p>AI-powered tool that analyzes resumes against job descriptions and provides instant, actionable feedback.</p> 

      <div>
<section>
  <p className='text-2xl font-bold mt-5'>Summary</p>
  The AI Resume Analyzer is a full-stack web application I built to streamline the job application process by helping candidates receive instant, AI-powered feedback on their resumes. The tool evaluates resumes against job descriptions, highlights strengths, identifies gaps, and provides actionable suggestions to improve candidate success rates.
This project reflects my expertise in Next.js, React, AI integrations, database design, and cloud deployment, while also showcasing my ability to build real-world, user-focused applications.

<section>
  <p className='text-2xl font-bold mt-5'>Problem Statement</p>
  <p>Many job seekers submit resumes that are either:</p>
<ul className='ml-5'>

<li>- Not tailored to the role.</li>
<li>- Lacking in clarity or keyword alignment.</li>
<li>- Failing to showcase their strongest achievements.</li>
</ul>
Recruiters often spend less than 7 seconds scanning a resume, which makes it critical for applicants to stand out. However, professional resume review services are often expensive, and most job seekers don‚Äôt have access to personalized, instant feedback.

<section>
  <p className='text-2xl font-bold mt-5'>Solution</p>
  <p>I developed the AI Resume Analyzer to bridge this gap by providing:</p>

  <ul className='ml-5'>

<li>- AI-Powered Feedback ‚Äì Uses LLMs to analyze resumes and compare them against job descriptions.</li>
<li>- Actionable Insights ‚Äì Provides specific recommendations (e.g., Add more measurable achievements under Work Experience).</li>
<li>- Seamless UX ‚Äì A clean, intuitive interface where users can upload resumes and paste job descriptions.</li>
<li>- Scoring System ‚Äì Rates resumes based on clarity, keyword alignment, and role fit.
</li>
</ul>
